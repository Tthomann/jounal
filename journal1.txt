-----------------
for the real "first day" for me was a really good refresher on html/css and from being in the previous class I feel really confident in my skills
to apply the knowledge that I know of on html/css on the test tomorrow. I edited my blog page and reviewed my code ( that I should really clean up..)
overall it was a successful day!
