Yesterday I worked on my website blog a little more and then took the test, which looked very similar to the first one. though it wasn't a display 
of my skills on the test when it came to the table part, I'm sure I did fine again. I already passed the exam with a 91% so I'm not too worried.
now we begin java, which I have very little experience in, so I'm exited to jump into it!
